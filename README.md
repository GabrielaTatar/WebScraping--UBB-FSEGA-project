The first button triggers web scraping from the website https://quotes.toscrape.com/ and then displays the obtained data in a table. 
Button 2 retrieves a record from an HTML form on the page, adds it to the data obtained in the previous step, inserts the entire dataset into Json Server, and displays it in a new table.
Button 3 deletes a record based on the id field. 
The front-end part is implemented in JavaScript, while the back-end part is in PHP.
